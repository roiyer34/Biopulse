Our entry for the 2023 Hello World Hackathon at Purude.

A full stack web application that uses catagorical regression to output a diagnosis given a list of symptoms chosen by the user. Users can log in and their username and password is stored in a sqlite database. Their previous diagnoses are stored and can be viewed by the user sorted by date of the diagnosis. We call an api to get more data about each condition so the user knows what their diagnosis actually means.
